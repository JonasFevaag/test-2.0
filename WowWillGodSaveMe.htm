<h1>wow will god save me</h1>
<h2 id="C1">chapter 1</h2>
<p>this is a text about me hating god idk why i wrote this text but i did PG12</p>
<p>wow will god save me frfr i hope so, but no god hates me because i am now locked out of google for trying to logg in with a code that wont work even if i tryed thank you oh good lord and savior i now hate you as well F*CK YOU B*TCH. like fr god please make outlook send a code that actualy works please it would be very nice if you did, but still i have to wait a few hours before i can try again but please let the new code work. i am frfr going to die soon if you dont fix this issue please fix it i need to log in to google. but if things wernt so difficult to log in to then it would be fine but no they make it harder for other people to get in to your account but they make it more difficult for everyone even the person that owns the computer. and i swear if gods actually behind this we are going to have a problem so what i say to you god is i hope you let me log in or i will find a way to kill you. and i know where you live you piece of sh*t and i will find you in your home and i will kill you with a f***ing nuke and i will forever hate you. and now i have writen more then i ever would to someone i dont even belive exists. and i will also miss the nuke on purposs so you can have more pain then have ever had in your life before you die:). and even if god didnt do it i still hope you die. i just tryed again and still didnt work so that means you are a bad god and you will die even if you dont want to die. and the sad ting is that i cant even change the f***ing password.</p>

<p>what ever will i do idk dad tolled me to wait so its kinda sad. Hilde you can read this if you want or if i find you. i should prob stop writing and waisting my time, but no brain cant stop right now. and at this point pray to the devil because god will be dead and the devil is not so all i have to say to god is that i hope you become nicer to me before i find you. then you might live MIGHT, but right now i hate you and the only resone you might live is if you keep being nice to me you b*tch. why the f*ck am i writing this because i hate god, and if only god wouldnt have locked me out of my google account then i wouldnt be here writing this at all. oh no im running out of space to write on we will see how far i can get by complaining to god yippi. what would god do if i showed up to your house with a f***ing knife or gun what would god do kill me oh hell no i am to angry with god to die now. the only resone i will die is if i say strike me down zuse but why would i when i can kill him to. now after killing god him self, i can go on with killing every other god, but not satan he is actually nicer then god him self.</p>
<p>the resone i wrote this text is because i got locked out of my google account and got mad so i took my anger out on writing a text</p>
<p>to sum things up i hate god super easy and simple and the devil is supirior to you god.</p>
<p>i love god</p>

<p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?</p>
